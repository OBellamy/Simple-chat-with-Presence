# Simple-chat-with-Presence
I've added presence functionality to my simple chat app


This app is still in a single HTML file and using the API key directly but has some great additional features:

This adds a clientID generated from a random number.

The messages published show the clientID and the message.
This also shows an updating list of all users online on the app at present.
